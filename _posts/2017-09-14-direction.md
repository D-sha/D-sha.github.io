So I've been writing and reading code for a while now, but I feel as if I'm only scratching the surface.

In my opinion programming is a practical skill that must be **practiced**. Books and videos can only take you so far.
In order to take a deep dive you need to just pick a field/framework/system and build it!. So I've picked android.
Why?
- Easy to test and deploy
- I'm comfortable with java
- massive user and developer base
- lots of documentation and resources

If you too wish to level up from learning a language to becoming comfortable using a language - jump in and make something!
And for me android is an excellent choice.
