title: A blog eh?

So ive decided it's time to start a blog to record all the random musings, tutorials, code snippets and the rest - so here it is... **Congratulations you've found it!**

## Build your own?

If you want to build something similar, go clone/fork : [lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) - it's **Amazaing** and follow the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) instructions, Its really that simple!
I also setup [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) locally to save a couple of pushes when testing.
I also needed:
> apt-get install ruby-dev zlib1g-dev python-ptyprocess python-pexpect python-gconf python-xdg

and create a file called "Gemfile" and add:
> source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins

to get bundle to build jekyll. After that run:
> bundle exec jekyll serve

To start the server <em>(page generation and server startup takes ~1 second on my tired old laptop) </em> and browse localhost:4000 and your all done! Really great experience.  
Leave the server running while changes are made and you get automatic **instantaneous** generation <em> (ok not really but: 0.198782435 seconds.) </em> and publishing!  
Kudos to all that were involved in these projects!
