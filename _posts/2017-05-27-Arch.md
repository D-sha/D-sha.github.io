It's been a long time since my last post....

So recently I've converted my system to [Arch](https://archlinux.org) linux which
I'm really enjoying. I do love debian but its just too old to use on a development desktop.
After getting used to the packaging tools I'm finally <em>slightly</em> productive again.
I'm still a little scared by the [AUR](https://aur.archlinu.org) but <strong>wow</strong> it has everything, just dont forget to read those PKGBUILD files!

<strong>Update to previous post</strong>
Arch specific instructions:
> pacman -S ruby  
gem install jekyll bundle  
bundle install

<ins> this doesnt work yet</ins>
