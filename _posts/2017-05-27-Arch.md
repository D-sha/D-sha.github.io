It's been a long time since my last post....

So recently I've converted my system to [Arch](https://archlinux.org) linux which
I'm really enjoying. I do love debian but its just too old to use on a development desktop and the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org) is just fantastic! also I love their motto: <strong>a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.</strong> - Thats excatly what im looking for.
After getting used to the packaging tools I'm finally <em>slightly</em> productive again.
I'm still a little scared by the [AUR](https://aur.archlinu.org) but <strong>wow</strong> it has everything, just dont forget to read those PKGBUILD files!  
<em>hint</em> [pacaur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=pacaur) and others are great for managing aur installed software.  

<strong>Update to previous post</strong>  
Arch specific instructions:  
Install ruby and a javascript runtime:
> pacman -S ruby nodejs

Install jekyll and bundle gems:
> gem install jekyll bundle  
bundle install
